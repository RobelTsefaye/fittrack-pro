/// the whole point — the user is looking at a different app in the
/// foreground). Once backgrounded, WKWebView suspends JS execution almost
/// immediately regardless of any `UIBackgroundModes` entitlement — those
/// entitlements extend *native* code's background runtime, not the web
/// content process's. So `CardioPictureInPicturePlugin` cannot rely on a
/// "JS receives cardioLiveUpdate → calls back into the plugin" round trip
/// once the app leaves the foreground; it subscribes here instead, and
/// `WatchConnectivityPlugin` publishes directly from its `WCSessionDelegate`
/// callback (native-to-native, no WebView involved).
